# Holizm
Holism is an **extremely opinionated** **SPL** (Software Product Line) for **SMBs** (Small to Mid-sized Businesses).

## Extremely opinionated
This means that what Holism says should be followed with 100% submission. Some parts of it are not the way the global community develops software.

## SPL
If you want to create one app, then Holism might not suit you. It shows its value when you intend to create multiple apps. And the more apps you build, the more it shines.

## SMB
If you have tons of money, this Holism is not for you. Holism is for anyone who does not have enough budget to spend on matters in software development that goes beyond libraries and frameworks.
